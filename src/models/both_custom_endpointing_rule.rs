Hot tip: - In JavaScript, escape `\\` when sending the regex pattern. Eg. `\"hello\\sthere\"` will be sent over the wire as `\"hellosthere\"`. Send `\"hello\\\\sthere\"` instead. - `RegExp.test` does substring matching, so `/cat/.test(\"I love cats\")` will return `true`. To do full string matching, send \"^cat$\".
